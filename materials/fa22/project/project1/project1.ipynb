    "**Deadline.**  This project is due at **11:00pm PT on Friday 9/30**. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.**  For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up to the checkpoint, pass all public autograder tests for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 1 Checkpoint assignment by **11:00pm PT on Friday, 9/23**. **This is worth 5% of your entire project grade**. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission, to the Project 1 assignment, will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. **Only one of you is allowed to submit the project. If both partners submit, you will be docked 10% of your project grade. On Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope.\n",

The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Ed post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help.

Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",

    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",

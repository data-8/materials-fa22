    "Project 1 is going to be released on the date specified at the **top of this lab**! You have the option of working with a partner that is enrolled in your lab. Your GSI will be sending out a form to match you up with a partner for this project. You may also indicate if you're working alone or have already found a partner and do not need to be paired up. This form is **mandatory** - please fill it out before submitting your lab. Set `submitted` to `True` once you've submitted the form.\n",

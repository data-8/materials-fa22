    "Welcome to Data 8: *Foundations of Data Science*!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly lab sessions are designed to develop your skills with computational and inferential concepts. These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Monday nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the policies for getting full credit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For those attending in-person **Regular Labs**: you will receive lab credit by **attending** lab section and making progress by completing up to the **checkpoint** in this notebook. You still need to **submit** this assignment to Gradescope after getting checked off, but you do not need to complete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For those attending **Mega Labs**: you will receive lab credit by **completing** the notebook, passing the test cases, and **submitting** it to Gradescope by 11pm on the Friday the same week it was released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Regular Lab sections will not be recorded, the Mega Lab sections will be recorded and available to all students for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). You can add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please feel free to add yourself to the queue whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification -- we are more than happy to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask an instructor or classmate for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it). Please don't just share answers, though. More information on academic honesty can be found [here](http://data8.org/fa22/policies/#academic-honesty).\n",

    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic **expressions** in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call **functions** to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",

You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data. An array could contain all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations. The [Python Reference](http://data8.org/python-reference/python-reference.html) has information that will be useful for this lab.\n",

The second argument can be thought of as how many steps right or left you move from the decimal point. Negative numbers tell us to move left, and positive numbers tell us to move right. So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200.0. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8."

To do this, you can use `tbl.with_column(col_name, col_values)`: a table method that takes in the name of the new column and an array of values and returns a copy of the original `tbl` with the new column.  Then, use `where` to find rows where that new column is equal to 0.  Finally, use `num_rows` to count the number of such rows.\n",
